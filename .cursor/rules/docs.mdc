# Friendlines – Documentation Rule

## Purpose
Ensure any code change that affects API behaviour is mirrored in `/backend/api_docs` and high-level `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

## When to Invoke
Trigger this rule **when**:
1. Adding/updating/deleting Express routes.
2. Modifying response shapes or status codes.
3. Introducing new models or fields.
4. Changing validation rules or rate limits.

## Checklist
- [ ] Update or create the corresponding markdown under `/backend/api_docs/**`.
- [ ] If endpoints were added/removed, regenerate tables in `api_docs/endpoints/*`.
- [ ] Run `npm run docs:lint` (custom script) to validate links & front-matter.
- [ ] Keep examples up to date with sample payloads.

## Style Guide
• Use **present tense**, active voice.<br/>• Headers: `##` for top-level, `###` for endpoint methods.<br/>• Include **Request**, **Response**, **Error Responses** sections.<br/>• All JSON blocks must be **pretty-printed** with 2-space indent.<br/>• Provide example `curl` commands.

## Tools
A helper script `backend/split_api_docs.js` splits unified docs; rerun after big changes.

## Verification
CI step `docs-check` ensures no broken links or missing endpoint references. Fix failures before merging.
