# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documentation from the Friendlines v2.0 development process. These documents capture important implementation details and decisions made during major feature development.

## Archived Documents

## Why These Are Archived

These documents served important purposes during development:
- **Implementation Records**: Detailed technical decisions and migration steps
- **Feature Demonstrations**: Working examples and test scenarios
- **Development History**: Context for major architectural changes

However, they are now **superseded by**:
- **Current API Documentation**: [../../api_docs/](../../api_docs/) - Up-to-date endpoint documentation
- **Master Changelog**: [../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) - High-level version history
- **Main README**: [../../README.md](../../README.md) - Current project overview

## Using Archived Documentation

These documents remain valuable for:
- **Understanding implementation history** and technical decisions
- **Reference during future migrations** or architectural changes
- **Context for troubleshooting** legacy compatibility issues
- **Learning from past development processes**
