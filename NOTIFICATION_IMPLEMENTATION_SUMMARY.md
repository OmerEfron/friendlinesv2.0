# Notification Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added push notifications for group invitations and friend requests to the Friendlines v2.0 system.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Group Invitation Notifications

**When triggered:**
- When a user invites someone to join a group
- When someone accepts a group invitation

**Notification details:**
- **Invitation sent**: Notifies invited user with title "Group Invitation!" and message including inviter name and group name
- **Invitation accepted**: Notifies group owner with title "Group Invitation Accepted!" and message including new member name and group name

**Implementation location:** `controllers/groupController.js`
- `inviteToGroup()` function: Sends notification to invited users
- `acceptInvitation()` function: Sends notification to group owner

### 2. Friend Request Notifications

**When triggered:**
- When a user sends a friend request
- When someone accepts a friend request

**Notification details:**
- **Request sent**: Notifies target user with title "New Friend Request!" and message including requester name
- **Request accepted**: Notifies original requester with title "Friend Request Accepted!" and message including accepter name

**Implementation location:** `controllers/authController.js`
- `sendFriendRequest()` function: Sends notification to target user
- `acceptFriendRequest()` function: Sends notification to original requester

## Technical Implementation

### Notification Service Integration
- Added `sendPush` and `getFriendTokens` imports to both controllers
- Non-blocking notification sending (wrapped in try-catch)
- Graceful error handling - operations succeed even if notifications fail

### Notification Payload Structure
Each notification includes:
- **Title**: Descriptive notification title
- **Body**: Human-readable message
- **Data**: Structured payload with:
  - `type`: Notification type identifier
  - Relevant IDs and names for deep linking
  - Timestamp and metadata

### Error Handling
- Notifications are sent asynchronously and don't block the main operation
- Comprehensive logging for successful sends and failures
- Invalid token handling through existing notification service

## API Documentation Updates

Updated `api_docs/architecture/push_notifications_architecture.md` to include:
- New notification triggers and types
- Updated implementation status
- Detailed notification payload structures
- Integration points documentation

## Testing

Created `tests/notification-integration.test.js` with tests for:
- Group invitation notifications
- Group invitation acceptance notifications
- Friend request notifications
- Friend request acceptance notifications
- Error handling when notifications fail

## Notification Types Added
